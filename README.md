# Apps
Here are some android apps that I have created. All of them were created with Java. All apps that I have published are available at [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=frogitecture).

## Games
All games were created with a basic game engine that is based on the book Beginning Android Games Development: From Beginner to Pro.
